# Soirée #1

> **SATURDAY, JUNE 13th, 2020** - please join us for a *10 person or under* soirée at The Cathedral in Brooklyn, NY. **Begins at 7pm**

## WHAT DO 
> This is an effort to say *fuck you lockdown* while also being *clean*, *festive*, and *social*! By jamming out with impromptu music-making sessions and such. Good times to be had by all.

- **WE WILL HAVE A [KEG OF BEER](https://www.brooklynkegs.com/six-point-bengali-tiger-ipa-sixtel-keg-5-16-gal)!!**

- *Bring your musical instrument please -- acoustic/analog only por favor*

- **Bring POT! We will have INDIVIDUAL VOLCANO BAGS FOR EACH GUEST - A CLEAN, HEALTHY WAY TO GET STONED LIKE A FOX**

- *A friendly crowd of cool people who like music and are chill!*

- No money required this shit is for cool people and is therefore my gift to you for being cool

### We're Cool Because We Are Friends

We may do a little bit of recording during the proceeds of the evening. This is mainly so that we can show off how we are cool for getting together and being humans. We will totally not capture you on audio or video unless you are comfy with it.

## Cleanliness

This shit will be done clean.

- Individually-labeled disposable cupware
- Enough seating to promote comfortable, respectfully-distant socializing
- Individual volcano bags *for each stoner who attends*
