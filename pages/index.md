# **SONIC MULTIPLICITIES**

> *An effort by composer & audio engineer [Andrew Grathwohl](//multipli.city/Andrew-Grathwohl/) to construct a unified, broadened musical consciousness out of today's technologies of war, aiming to propel elite instrumentalists' capabilities towards the outer-most reaches of musical aptitude.*


# Sound is our study. Data is our religion

> What results from this ambitious musical endeavor is among the world's longest-running datasets comprised of advanced, complex, and challenging extended techniques, free improvisation strategem, and instrumental varieties.

## The Anti-Computer Music
> **Software** should liberate, enable, and optimize. Music software in vogue today needlessly limits, restricts, and constrains. Long live the human spirit that lives within *music* and free software!

- **SM** emphasizes the soloist's *novel fundamentals*
- **SM** is an AI free improvisation *friend*
- **SM** is contact-free yet is an incredible *listener*

Music begins and ends with acoustic output from a human being. We provide a real-time musical AI that can talk back to that most infinite of mankind's oldest language.

<!--
### Honesty
Our recorded works follow a strict production code:

- All recordings are live, captured in real-time, with no additional edits, mixing, or post-processing performed.
- **SM** performances are output in 20-channel third-order ambisonics, and from there are mixed down to stereo and binaural with automated software.
