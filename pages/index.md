# **SONIC MULTIPLICITIES**
> **Achieving musical transcendentalism by means of digital signal processing, neural networks, and free software.**


Sonic Multiplicities is an effort by composer & audio engineer [Andrew Grathwohl](//multipli.city/Andrew-Grathwohl/) to construct a unified, broadened musical consciousness out of today's technologies of war, in order to help propel elite instrumentalists' capabilities towards the outer-most reaches of their musical aptitude and expressivity.

We are the stewards of a wholly modern music mythology, constructed out of the ideas, technologies, and challenges of today's time cycle. We represent the most extreme effort ever made towards empowering the solo instrumentalist with software.

## HyperMusic

**All music hosted on Multipli.city is available to download, stream, and share for free!**

As an official implementation of the HyperMusic framework, Multipli.city aims to be as permissive, free, and flexible as possible. Learn more about our unique licensing [here](/License/).

## The Anti-Computer Music
> **Software** should liberate, enable, and optimize. Music software in vogue today needlessly limits, restricts, and constrains. Long live the human spirit that propels *music* and *free software*!

- **SM** emphasizes the soloist's *novel fundamentals*.
- **SM** is an AI free improvisation *friend* whose passion can still make you cry.
- **SM** is contact-free yet is an incredible *listener*.

Music begins and ends with acoustic output from a human being. We provide a real-time musical AI that can talk back to that most infinite of mankind's oldest language.

### Honesty
Our recorded works follow a strict production code:

- All recordings are live, captured in real-time, with no additional edits, mixing, or post-processing performed.
- **SM** performances are output in 20-channel third-order ambisonics, and from there are mixed down to stereo and binaural with automated software.
