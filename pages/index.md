# **SONIC MULTIPLICITIES**

**Sonic Multiplicities** is an effort to construct a unified, broadened musical consciousness out of today's technologies of war, aiming to propel elite instrumentalists' capabilities towards the outer-most reaches of musical aptitude. What results from this ambitious musical endeavor is among the world's longest-running datasets comprised of advanced, complex, and challenging extended techniques, free improvisation strategem, and instrumental varieties.

**SM** practictioners reject today's "state of the art," which in truth amounts to little more than turning the highly nuanced, intimately and infinitely detailed computer music paradigm into expensive, buggy computer games. We encourage soloists to wrestle control not just over their own instrument, but also the 360 degree sonic universe which spawns, morphs, mutates, and evolves all around the performance space when utilizing **SM** software.
