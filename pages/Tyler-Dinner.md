# Tyler Dinner
Born and raised in Monterey, CA, Tyler quickly turned a teenage song-writing hobby into a musical obsession, and eventually quit college baseball in order to pursue this passion. After trying to get bands together in Cali, Tyler teamed up with his brother and moved to New York City in 2008 to make music their main focus. After spending his 20s honing his techniques on keys, harmonica, guitars and production, Tyler is currently gearing up for releases with multiple bands and projects. Ranging from blues to soulful acoustic tracks to bombastic rock, he effortlessly blends genres while keeping the focus on songwriting. Among the most intriguing upcoming releases is a selection of progressive improvisations featuring accompaniment by an incredible new machine-learning backed computer engine known as Sonic Multiplicities.
