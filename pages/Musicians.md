# **MUSICIAN AGREEMENT**
> **All musicians that perform with Sonic Multiplicities should be aware of the
> implications and outcomes resulting from that choice.**

#### A few notes before we begin...

It is the responsibility of each performer to understand and be able to operate
within the technical concepts explained on this page.

All visitors to this page should expect to have their IP address logged in order
to validate that they have read the information contained below.

**Please email [Andrew Grathwohl](mailto:andrew@multipli.city) with any questions
related to these matters.**

## Background

Playing Sonic Multiplicities music is a pretty sweet deal for the musicians who
embrace the opportunity. Not only will you be a participant in one of the most
exciting and revolutionary integrations of free improvisation and artificial
intelligence out there today, you will also get a trick-ass audio master of your
performance - and perhaps even more.

It has taken a lot of time, personal expense, and hardship to get the SM project
where it is today. It challenges the current musical environment in more ways
than the purely performative - we also take great leaps forward in how we treat
rights, licensing, privacy, and even music releases.

Therefore, your participation in SM is bound to your understanding of the below
information. We put this document together in order to provide the full scope
of what performing with SM means.

**SM performances have life-long implications.** Your contribution to the SM
training data will contribute to the outcomes of each and every musician that
comes to perform on SM after you. Your own outcomes were very much dictated by
the actions, choices, and decisions made by the performers that came before you.

## Data We Ingest
> Without exceptions, every single Sonic Multiplicities performance is thoroughly
> documented. This is the data we take in, and what we do with that data.

### Before the Performance

Before any performance officially begins the SM software begins recording a 22
channel PCM audio file to disk. Performers should therefore expect to have their
musical performance as well as their spoken conversations recorded to disk.

### During the Performance

Audio data is analyzed and logged in real-time by the SM software. This analysis
and logging data is saved to the SM's data storage backend, retained indefinitely
for the purposes of training the SM machine learning implementations.

### After the Performance

In addition to the real-time data collected, the SM machine learning
implementations are trained on other data adjacent to the SM performance. This
includes the precise date & time the performance took place, the GPS location
of the performance, and the results of all API calls made before, during, and
after the recording took place.

## Licenses & Credits

All performers surrender their rights of music ownership and publication to Andrew
Grathwohl, who also retains 50% of the compositional credit. The remaining 50% is
split evenly between each participant in the recording.

Unless significant contributions were made, no performer may claim credits for
production roles. Audio engineering, audio mixing, audio tracking, audio mastering,
and all other such credits are assigned to Andrew Grathwohl.

### Releases

Performers must understand that any and all Sonic Multiplicities recordings are
viable for release for free on the official Sonic Multiplicities podcast feed,
as well as other web endpoints that provide free audio streaming services such
as the [Multipli.city](https://multipli.city) homepage and SoundCloud.

Andrew Grathwohl and Sacred Data, LLC retain exclusive rights to use SM audio
recordings to produce new music releases, including physical CD & vinyl. These
releases will be available on, in addition to the free resources listed above,
paid digital streaming services and physical media.

#### Profits made from releases go directly into financing new opportunities for SM performance.

Performers with more than 20 titles under their belt (as listed on
the [Multipli.city](https://multipli.city) homepage) are entitled to the use of
SM funds for new experiments such as instrument modifications, equipment purchases,
and accessories for the creation of new sonic palettes.

Performers with more than 50 titles are entitled to the use of SM funds to pay for
travel, room and board expenses relating to new SM endeavors.
