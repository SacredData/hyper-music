## Artistic Statement
Reports prior to and during WWII identified a common issue with the earlier vintage of steam-powered ships. The fire room - that place where poor, miserable people shoveled coal into fire burners to heat up the steam, which powered the engines inside the engine room - was first put behind an airlock, which, when it failed, would erupt in a fantastic ball of fire and kill every last person in the room, and often times, the entire ship itself.

We are pretty sure this violin composition, performed expertly by master Sonicmeister Garrett Semmelink, is exactly what those fire rooms sounded like. Listen for yourself, and as always, we encourage you not to die.
