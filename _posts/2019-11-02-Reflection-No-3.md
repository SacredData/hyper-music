## Artistic Statement
Garrett Semmelink, our master Sonicmeister, embarks on his most ambitious and awe-inspiring Reflection piece to date! Reflection No. 3 is a heroic odyssey told by the cunning whip of Semmelink's bow, his glorious and outrageous powers imparting a remarkably spiritual imagery upon the musical AI's `VISUAL STEM`.

Witness the cunning and strategy employed by the Sonicmeister's careful intonation, tonal creation, and inter-tonal tonation-creations!
