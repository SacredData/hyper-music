In a moment of severe manufactured panic, we delegated powers to false prophets.
This led to crimes committed, against a majority of the Earth's population.
Their effects will be felt for years to come; we've yet to fully comprehend the
impact of these events, nearly three years later.

Our followers will note the considerable date gap between our latest work of
Sonic Multiplicities, and our prior works. The public health vampires that the
population allowed to wield dictatorial control over our minds and bodies
committed crimes against both Andrew and Garrett that would be unthinkable in
years past.

- We both lost our profitable and prestigious jobs.
- We both faced serious health emergencies which the hospitals refused to treat.
- We both had friends and close family die far too young from suicide and despair.
- We both were let down by institutions, groups, and individuals who we thought we
could trust.
- We both watched music be misconstrued as an act of selfish, pessimistic evil -
intentionally, by people who wish us great harm.

Worse of all, we are incredibly aware that we are not alone in these harrowing
experiences.

We have gone to extraordinary lengths to keep our music and our way of life
alive. For Andrew, it required abandoning the city hellscape in favor of rural
acreage. We rebuilt our lives in order to keep our passions burning, meeting
incredible friends and well-wishers along the way. Music will never simply die.
Sonic Multiplicities is an ideal that cannot be put back into the bottle.

When we first started this project, we were naively unaware of how much the
world would eventually become a polar opposite of the one we hoped and dreamed
for. As "AI art" enters the global conversation via the corporate press and
people continue reeling from the censorship and other dangers of centralized
cloud computing, SM would appear to be as prescient an idea as ever.

SM will live on, and so we announce **Sonic Multiplicities 4.0**.
