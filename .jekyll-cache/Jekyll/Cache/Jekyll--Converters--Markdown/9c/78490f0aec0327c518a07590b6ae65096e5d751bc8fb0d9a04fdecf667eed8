<p>People Over Platforms, 2020 features the sweet licks and profound ingenuity of guitarist, Tyler Dinner. He takes us on a wild ride through his mind - a place where the 1970s never ended. It’s surprising, it’s magical, it’s profoundly original. Say hello to the other Multiplicity. You cannot escape it.</p>
