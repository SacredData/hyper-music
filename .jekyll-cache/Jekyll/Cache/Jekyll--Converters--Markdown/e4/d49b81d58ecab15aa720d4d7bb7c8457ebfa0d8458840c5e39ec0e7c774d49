<p>An effort by composer &amp; audio engineer Andrew Grathwohl to construct a unified, broadened musical consciousness out of today‚Äôs technologies of war, aiming to propel elite instrumentalists‚Äô capabilities towards the outer-most reaches of musical aptitude.</p>

<p>What results from this ambitious musical endeavor is among the world‚Äôs longest-running datasets comprised of advanced, complex, and challenging extended techniques, free improvisation strategem, and instrumental varieties.</p>

<h1 id="sound-is-our-study-data-is-our-religion">Sound is our study. Data is our religion</h1>

<h2 id="the-anti-computer-music">The Anti-Computer Music</h2>
<p>Fuck all the synchronized bleepity-bloops, messes of wires, and nonsense proprietary ‚ÄúDAW‚Äù software. Our approach to computer music invokes a little-known dark art within the sonic realm. We find the diamonds in your sound and make it the rough. With your sound, we drench the soundstage with the deepest, most passionate memories your instrument. Because software is not an instrument, and your goofy computer toys are not ‚Äúhardware.‚Äù</p>

<p>Music begins and ends with acoustic output from a human being. We provide a real-time musical AI that can talk back to that most infinite of mankind‚Äôs oldest language.</p>
