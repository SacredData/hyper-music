<p>Reports prior to and during WWII identified a common issue with the earlier vintage of steam-powered ships. The fire room - that place where poor, miserable people shoveled coal into fire burners to heat up the steam, which powered the engines inside the engine room - was first put behind an airlock, which, when it failed, would erupt in a fantastic ball of fire and kill every last person in the room, and often times, the entire ship itself.</p>
