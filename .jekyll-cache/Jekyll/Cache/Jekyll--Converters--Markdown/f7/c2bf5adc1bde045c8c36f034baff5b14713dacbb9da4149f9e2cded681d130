<blockquote>
  <p><em>An effort by composer &amp; audio engineer <a href="//multipli.city/Andrew-Grathwohl/">Andrew Grathwohl</a> to construct a unified, broadened musical consciousness out of todayâ€™s technologies of war, aiming to propel elite instrumentalistsâ€™ capabilities towards the outer-most reaches of musical aptitude.</em></p>

<h1 id="sound-is-our-study-data-is-our-religion">Sound is our study. Data is our religion</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>What results from this ambitious musical endeavor is among the worldâ€™s longest-running datasets comprised of advanced, complex, and challenging extended techniques, free improvisation strategem, and instrumental varieties.</p>

<h2 id="the-anti-computer-music">The Anti-Computer Music</h2>
<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Software</strong> should liberate, enable, and optimize. Music software in vogue today needlessly limits, restricts, and constrains. Long live the human spirit that is carried within <em>music</em> and <em>free software</em>!</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>SM</strong> emphasizes the soloistâ€™s <em>novel fundamentals</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>SM</strong> is an AI free improvisation <em>friend</em> whose passion can still make you cry.</li>
  <li><strong>SM</strong> is contact-free yet is an incredible <em>listener</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Music begins and ends with acoustic output from a human being. We provide a real-time musical AI that can talk back to that most infinite of mankindâ€™s oldest language.</p>

### Honesty
Our recorded works follow a strict production code:

- All recordings are live, captured in real-time, with no additional edits, mixing, or post-processing performed.
- **SM** performances are output in 20-channel third-order ambisonics, and from there are mixed down to stereo and binaural with automated software.
